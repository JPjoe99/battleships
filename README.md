# Battleships

A simple version of Battleships, developed as part of the recruitment process for 
the Graduate Developer role at Guestline. The application allows a player to play
a one-sided game of Battleships against ships that have been randomly placed by
the computer.

This application was developed using the object-oriented features of TypeScript.
